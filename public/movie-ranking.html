<h1>The Best Movies According to Connor</h1> 
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite movies because the sci fi is so cool.</p> 
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>This whole series was my childhood, as you can see there is a common theme with <br />
sci-fi. </p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>  
<p>I forget which are my favorite, however any of the original six are amazing plus The <br />
Mandalorian was also great.</p>
